<h2>Blend In!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game came from many sacrifices of previous ideas.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game features sound effects to show if the one player is guessing correctly or not while also playing music.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<ul> I learned more about phaser, including how some of the physics and sound modules work. </ul>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul> Originally the idea was for the fake boxes to change color when they collide with the tile map, but I could not get it to work, so that would be the most difficult aspect. </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borrowed the tiles from OpenGameArt.ORG, made the tile map myself, the sound effects are from Mario and Luigi Super Star Saga, the Boxes I created myself and the Music was made by my roomate Ali Asif.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Code from the following examples:
<ul>
<li><a href = https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/on-collide-event> Collision </a></li>
<li><a href = "https://phaser.io/examples/v2/audio/sound-complete"> Sound </a></li>


<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Find the Other Player amongst all of the other boxes!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul> Input: Keyboard  and Mouse</ul>
<ul> Genre: Asymetric Competative Point and Click Arcade game </ul>
<ul> No randomness. </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I wanted to marry the elements that work from point and click games with the energy of a competative game.
<ul> 	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul> I want the game to be easy to understand and quick to pick up. </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype�s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul> One Player uses the arrow keys to mimmic bounces, controlled by a second player. The second player's goal is to spot the first player and pick them out before time runs out. </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul> Being able to spot your box before your opponent at the start, and avoid the mouse. Don't sit still! </ul>
</li>

A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul> A bunch of flashy boxes are scaterred by a computer mouse. </ul>

</li>
