<ul>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
            Its a competative multiplayer shooter that won't let you sit still and tests your platforming abilities.
</li>

        <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
            Nothing revolutionary, or worthy of interest.
</li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
            I spent most of this prototype trying to get the physics to operate,

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                I did not create original assets instead borrowing from the Phaser tutorials and the background coming from Microsoft's 'Bliss' wallpaper from Windows XP
</li>
            

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game borrows elements from Mario Bros. , Joust and Balloon Fight in terms of fast paced close interactions with the other player. The only code that was borrowed was for the shooting mechanic and player movement, though both ended
    up heavily modified in the end to fit my own needs.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A 2D fast paced multiplayer arena shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
No Real story for this game
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I focused on a playstyle that allowed for simple fast action that wouldn't allow for you to sit still at any moment.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Sidescrolling shooting, and platforming.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To have a fast, fun local multiplayer experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game is played with 2 players, a field and 2 homing stars. The stars will continuosly follow you, each being the opposite color of you to show they are not to be touched. Movement is with W A S D and the arrow keys, Player 1 shoots with CONTROL and Player 2 shoots with 'E'
    Each shot is worth 1 point and teleports you to a random point on the map. The enemy star touching you also teleports you but deducts 2 points. If you manage to  touch the star matching your color (your enemies star) you will recieve 3 pts and be teleported randomly on the map.
    Each of those mechanics is present, what is lacking from the prototype is polish, adding death zone to the bottom of the map, a propper start and game over screen and better respawning coordinates are a few features I would have implemented if I had the time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Shooting players before they reach your star will teleport them away from it, slowing their ability to raise their score.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Not relavent for this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual players trying to play somthing quick and fun locally.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
With no score cap, the game can go as long as a single minute or several hours.
</li>
