<h2>That Dog that can't stop thinking about those ghosts he saw last night.</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game started as a retooling of homing stars, hence the JS filename, but became its own game after I started playing around with a few ideas and incorporating them into the theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game has a difficulty that scales with the score of the player, mostly original assets and 1 whole sound clip.
    I attempted to modulate its pitch but couldnt get javascript to cooperate.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<ul> I got much better at producing and managing assets. </ul>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul> Easiest part was getting the base concept in play. I had a proto-proto type if you will, very early on. However, the small things ended up giving me the most trouble such as attempting to pitch modulate sound effects. </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borrowed the dog sprite OpenGameArt.ORG (though I created a few extra frames myself and stitched it together) , made the tiles and tile map myself, the sound clip is the dog note from mario paint, though I doubt it is the source of the sound bite.
<ul>
<li>Dog Sprite sheet: <a href = "https://opengameart.org/content/dog-sprites">here</a></li>
<li>Example of Various Mario Paint SFX: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDMvA7cYLr4"> here </a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Code mostly came either original to this project or borrowed elements from my previous games such as the timer events from the previous game or the state system
<ul>
<li><a href = https://pikminfan1.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/Digital_Assignment_3/> Project that this games skeleton came from </a></li>
<li><a href = "https://phaser.io/examples/v2/audio/sound-complete"> Sound </a></li>


<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Ward off Ghosts for as long as you can until you need to take a nap.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
    The theme I used was an animal that can't stop thinking about that dream it had last night.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul> Input: Keyboard (arrow keys) and Mouse</ul>
<ul> Genre: Single Player Arcade game </ul>
<ul> Randomness in the spawn of the enemies. </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I wanted to make a game with 2 play states similar to my previous game, but with a more intuitive aproach to the changing states.
<ul> 	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul> I want the game to be easy to understand but hard to master. </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeï¿½s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>  The Player can move left and right with the corrosponding arrow keys and jump with the up arrow. The player can also bark in any direction to ward off ghosts. If a ghost touches a player they most relocate ther body before your energy runs out.</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul> Getting back to your body is imperative when your score gets higher as more enemies spawn and your energy depletes faster </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul> This game is about a dog that can't stop thinking about the ghost's he saw in his dream last night. Staying up through the night, as the sun rises he is suddenly swarmed by the 
    same spectres that haunted him the night before, so he does what any dog would do, bark at them until they go away or he gets tired.</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul> People looking for a quick game featuring a dog. </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul> As short as 5 seconds but as long as you can survive. </ul>
</li>

</ul>
